superswitcher for Debian
------------------------

From now on, debian package includes

    /etc/xdg/autostart/SuperSwitcher.desktop

which causes it to run by default on graphical user sessions of all
users.

## If any user want to disable it.

Common desktop environments offer some kind of graphical interface
allowing each user to review such programs listing can prevent this.

The user can also manually:

    cp /etc/xdg/autostart/SuperSwitcher.desktop ~/.config/autostart/SuperSwitcher.desktop

and edit the copy so that the "Hidden" settings reads:

    Hidden=true

Note running instructions and caveats in README, especially:

  SuperSwitcher is best enjoyed if you automatically start the program
  whenever you log in.  To do this, from System -> Preferences -> Sessions,
  go to the Startup Programs tab and add superswitcher.

This might become automatic in a future version of the package.
