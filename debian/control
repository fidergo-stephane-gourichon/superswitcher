Description: Powerful window and workspace switching using the Super key
 SuperSwitcher is a (more feature-ful) replacement for the Alt-Tab window
 switching behavior and Ctrl-Alt-Left/Right/Up/Down workspace switching behavior
 that is currently provided by most desktop environments.
 .
 In a nutshell, with SuperSwitcher you'll be able to easily jump to windows,
 including by part of name, move them between desktop, perform some batch
 operations, with intuitive key combinations involving the Super key.
 .
 It's like having most benefits of a tiling window manager, without the hassle:
 no remembering of many obscure commands.  Try it, benefit immediately, you can
 learn the rest later.
